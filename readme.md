## ✨ Features

This prototype allows the player to interact with **Eleanora**, a special companion in her room/barracks. The implemented features are extensive and create a compelling gameplay loop:

*   **Layered Character System**: Eleanora's appearance is dynamically rendered using a layer system, allowing for seamless equipment and expression changes.
*   **Dynamic Reactions**: Eleanora reacts to clicks with different expressions and dialogue based on her current affinity level, making her feel more alive.
*   **Persistent Data**: The game state, including player name, progress, and inventory, is automatically saved to the browser's `localStorage`, allowing players to continue their game later.
*   **i18n Support**: Full internationalization for Spanish and English, with language selection during the intro and in the options menu.
*   **Core Stats System**:
    *   **Affinity**: Influenced by dialogues and actions, unlocking new interactions and equipment.
    *   **Energy**: Consumed by missions and passively regenerated over time.
    *   **Satiety**: Decreases over time and is restored by feeding, creating a resource management cycle.
*   **Main Actions**:
    *   🗣️ **Talk**: Engage in dynamic conversations where Eleanora addresses the player by different nicknames based on affinity.
    *   👕 **Equip**: Manage a full equipment system with slots for `top`, `bottom`, `suit`, `head`, and `weapon`.
    *   🤝 **Interact**: Feed Eleanora to restore her energy, affecting her satiety level.
    *   ⚔️ **Mission**: Send Eleanora on missions. Success rates and loot quality are influenced by her equipped weapon.
    *   🛠️ **Crafting**: A complete crafting system where players can combine materials to create new items, such as powerful equipment.
    *   🛒 **Market**: A two-way marketplace to buy new items, materials, and recipes, or sell surplus goods for money.
*   **Responsive Design**: The UI seamlessly adapts from desktop to mobile layouts.

## 🚀 Project Roadmap

This prototype has laid a strong foundation, but there's always more to build!

### Planned Features & Enhancements
- [ ] **Minigames**: Implement the "Play Minigame" feature to boost affinity.
- [ ] **Consumable Items**: Add functionality to use items like the Energy Drink directly from the inventory.
- [ ] **Recipe Book**: Create a UI for the recipe book so players can view known recipes.
- [ ] **Advanced Crafting**: Allow using more than one of each material in the crafting slots.
- [ ] **Story Progression**: Expand the dialogue system with a main storyline that unfolds as affinity grows.
- [ ] **Data Management**: Add options to import/export save data as a JSON file.

### Future Integrations
- [ ] **Backend & Database**: Migrate from `localStorage` to a proper backend service (like Firebase) to allow cross-device play.
- [ ] **Framework Migration**: Plan the migration of this vanilla JS prototype to a modern framework like **Angular** for better scalability and maintainability.
- [ ] **Desktop App**: Explore wrapping the web app with **Electron** for a standalone desktop version.
